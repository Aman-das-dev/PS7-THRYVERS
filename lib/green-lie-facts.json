      "verdict": "PARTIALLY VALID BUT MISLEADING",
      "reasoning": "This statement is somewhat valid because students CAN physically turn off lights and it costs them nothing. However, it's misleading because: (1) classroom lighting is only 2-3% of school energy use—HVAC, which students cannot control, is 50-60%; (2) students often lack authority to control lighting due to school policies and automated systems; (3) meaningful energy conservation requires infrastructure upgrades that students cannot enforce. The statement places symbolic responsibility on students while ignoring that schools and administrators have vastly more power to reduce energy consumption through building improvements and system upgrades. It's a green lie because it focuses on minor individual actions instead of addressing the major institutional sources of energy waste.",
